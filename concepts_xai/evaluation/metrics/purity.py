    Returns the purity score of the given soft concept representations `c_soft`

    value is higher if concepts encode unnecessary information from other
    concepts in their soft representation and lower otherwise. If zero, then
    all soft concept labels are considered to be "pure".

    We compute this metric by calculating the norm of the absolute difference
    between the purity matrix derived from the soft concepts and the purity
    matrix derived from an oracle model. This oracle model is trained using

        of any rank as long as the last dimension is the dimension used to
        separate distinct concept representations. If concepts have distinct
        array shapes for their representations, then this argument is expected
        to be a list of `n_concepts` np.ndarrays where the i-th element in the

        representation of concept i. If not given, then this matrix will be
        computed using the purity scores from the input soft representations.

        predicting true concept j using soft representations i, and returns a
